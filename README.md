This is a simple web application that demonstrates use of the Angular framework. It is based on the [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes) tutorial.

I have made some changes to the original tutorial code primarily to improve styling and add some features.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3.
